# TidyTuesday-Contributions

## 2021-02-09

This is my first TidyTuesday project. I chose to visualize 5 plots from this dataset and added some explanations for each of them. [Graph2](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/plot2.html) and [graph 3](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/plot3.html) are made by Plotly and the rest of them are made by ggplot2. The detailed version is in [webachive](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/professional-development-task.webarchive) and [rmd](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/Wealth%26Income.Rmd) files.

## Visualizations for Income
### Graph 1 Median Income Over Time by Race

From Graph 1, we can see that the Asian (alone) ethnic group has the highest median of income of all time and Asian (alone) and White are the two groups above the median for all races.
Whereas Hispanic (all race) and Black (alone) are above the median of all races and Black (alone) has the lowest median of income of all time from 1988 to 2019.

### Graph 2 Income Distribution vs Income Bracket Over Time for Different Races.

This interactive plot, Graph 2, shows the income distribution (%) of each ethnicity group in all income bracket from 1988 to 2019. The size of the points increases as the year goes by. The Black alone group occupies the largest proportion in the lowest income bracket, Under $15,000, and the Blackâ€™s proportion decreases as the income bracket goes up. The Hispanic (any race) group also follows this trend. Whereas most of the Asian alone distributes in the bracket of $50,000 to $74,999 or above. Notably, over recent years, the income distribution of Asian alone rises in the highest income bracket, $200,000 and over, so does White alone. The income proportion of White alone mainly concentrates on the middle and lower range of income bracket and only about 20% proportion earn above $150,000.

### Graph 3 Family Income by Races Over time

This interactive plot, Graph 3, shows the family incomes with upper-income status (90th income percentile) have increased from $95,000 in 1963 to $180,000 in 2016, representing a twofold increase. For middle-income status (50th income percentile) families, their incomes have slowly increased from $47,000 to $65,000. However, low-income status (10th income percentile) families remain familial incomes of around $14,000. Overall, the gaps between the upper and lower familial income have widened over time.

## Visualizations for Wealth
### Graph 4 Visualization of Wealth By gender and race

Graph 4 shows that the average lifetime earnings vary between different races and genders. The largest gender disparity of average lifetime earning is between White women and White men for about $1,000,000 and the smallest is between Black women and men. However, regarding races, both  White women's and men's average lifetime earnings are higher compared with Hispanic's and Black's.

### Graph 5 Visualization of family wealth between White and Black ethnic groups

In 1983, white families had `$92,045` in median more wealth normalized to 2016 than black families. By 2016, the disparity in family wealth grew to `$153,591`. Notably, the biggest disparity between white and black families is `$174,304` in 2007. When the global recession continues, the median wealth in white families dropped dramatically by `$50,000` in the next three years while in black families only dropped a little.
