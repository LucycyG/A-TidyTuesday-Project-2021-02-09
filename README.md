# TidyTuesday-Contributions

## 2021-02-09

This is my first TidyTuesday project. I chose to visualize 5 plots from this dataset and added some explanations for each of them. [Graph2](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/plot2.html) and [graph 3](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/plot3.html) are made by Plotly and the rest of them are made by ggplot2. The detailed version is in [webachive](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/professional-development-task.webarchive) and [rmd](https://github.com/LucycyG/A-TidyTuesday-Project-2021-02-09/blob/main/Wealth%26Income.Rmd) files.

### Graph 1

From Graph 1, we can see that the Asian (alone) ethnic group has the highest median of income of all time and Asian (alone) and White are the two groups above the median for all races.
Whereas Hispanic (all race) and Black (alone) are above the median of all races and Black (alone) has the lowest median of income of all time from 1988 to 2019.

### Graph 4

Graph 4 shows that the average lifetime earnings vary between different races and genders. The largest gender disparity of average lifetime earning is between White women and White men for about $1,000,000 and the smallest is between Black women and men. However, regarding races, both  White women's and men's average lifetime earnings are higher compared with Hispanic's and Black's.

### Graph 5

In 1983, white families had `$92,045` in median more wealth normalized to 2016 than black families. By 2016, the disparity in family wealth grew to `$153,591`. Notably, the biggest disparity between white and black families is `$174,304` in 2007. When the global recession continues, the median wealth in white families dropped dramatically by `$50,000` in the next three years while in black families only dropped a little.
